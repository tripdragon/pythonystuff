Various stuff for python work. With it being small tasks its pointless to spin repos for each

**build_video_files.py** Process/Compress a folder of videos

**Blender folder** 3 scripts, 2 for making tool bar buttons, 1 for wrapping object in parent

**neuralish_network** This is not useful to anyone, its just the work to learn neural networks, it will have a javascript mirror to it as well
